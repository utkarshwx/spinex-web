        <p>Interventional pain management offers a targeted approach to pain relief. It utilizes image-guided
          injections, often using X-ray or CT scans, to deliver medication directly to the source of your pain. This can
          include injections into joints or the discs between spinal bones. In many cases, interventional pain
          management can help patients avoid the need for surgery.</p>
